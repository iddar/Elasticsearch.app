### Version numbers

Version numbers of this project (Redis.app) try to communicate the version of the included Redis binaries bundled with each release.

The version number also includes a build number which is used to indicate the current version of Redis.app and it's independent from the bundled Redis's version.

### Adding Redis binaries to your path

If you need to add the Redis binaries to your path you can do so by adding the following to your `~/.bash_profile`.

```bash
# Add Redis.app binaries to path
PATH="/Applications/Redis.app/Contents/Resources/Vendor/redis/bin:$PATH"
```

Or using the `path_helper` alternative:
 
 ```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
echo /Applications/Redis.app/Contents/Resources/Vendor/redis/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/redisapp
 ```
 
### Installing with Homebrew Cask

You can also install Redis.app with [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/).

```
